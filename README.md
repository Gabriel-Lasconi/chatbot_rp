This project is a chatbot developed during my Bachelor research project at the University of Twente and designed to understand team emotions and map them to Tuckmanâ€™s stages of team development (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning).

## Features

- **Emotion Detection:** Uses a zero-shot classification model to find emotional cues in user text.
- **Stage Mapping:** Connects the detected emotion to a relevant Tuckman stage.
- **Feedback Generation:** Provides stage-based recommendations to help improve team dynamics.
